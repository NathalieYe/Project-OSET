    <h3>Modeling</h3>
    <p>Modeling   ensures   that   students  have   a   clear   understanding   of   the components of a skill or strategy. Modeling is used to represent what experts do and to make skills and strategies explicit. When teachers model, they provide a clear explanation and demonstrate how to complete a task, often using a think aloud. When working with students with disabilities, models should be frequent and detailed. </p>

    [collapsible heading="Why is modeling important for students with disabilities?" elem="h4"]
    <p>Issues with memory and information processing are particularly challenging for students with disabilities. If their brains are consumed by committing information to memory or recalling information, it means that they can less fluidly complete tasks. Modeling lessens the cognitive load by breaking skills or strategies into essential steps; students with disabilities benefit from someone demonstrating a skill successfully and from hearing the internal dialogue of someone who is proficient in that skill.</p>
