    <!--What We Do-->
    <div class="top_container about_content_2">
        <p>We conduct research on students with disabilities access to learning opportunities across
        general and special education settings in K-12 public schools. We know that access to high-quality learning
        opportunities is not just a matter of an individual teachers’ skills, but of the ways their schools are
        organized. The instruction provided to students with disabilities is shaped by teachers’ experiences within
        their schools, including teacher evaluation. In this project, we offer resources to help practitioners — in
        particular, observers — think about and evaluate instruction, and to improve teachers’ professional learning
        experiences. Our goal is to use innovative methods to share our work with teachers and administrators so that
        the observation experience better reflects and responds to the instructional needs of students with
        disabilities.</p>
    </div>
  
    <!--Why We Care-->
    <div class="top_container about_content_3">
      <p>Despite decades of research in special education, students with disabilities consistently lag
        behind their peers in their rate of academic growth. Research shows that the type of instruction students with
        disabilities receive — including the content addressed and the practice used to address that content — is
        associated with improved academic outcomes. In short, when instruction is sufficiently systematic,
        individualized, and explicit there are big payoffs. Yet, many of the observation systems used in K-12 settings
        don’t clearly target the need for this type of instruction.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, emerging research suggests that many administrators feel they lack the knowledge
        and skill necessary to serve as a resource regarding the instructional needs of students with disabilities. When
        the tools used to evaluate instruction are not aligned to the evidence base and administrators and other
        observers operate from an impoverished knowledge base, we miss an important opportunity to improve instruction
        and academic outcomes for students with disabilities. We believe that rigorous research is an important part of
        changing policy and practice and that finding creative and efficient ways to share our research could be one way
        to support these changes. Project OSET is one way we hope to share our research.</p>
    </div>
  
    <div class="about_involve_wrapper about_content_4">
      <p class="about_get_involved">To conduct high quality research, we depend on K-12 practitioners, including
        teachers, principals, and district administrators, to participate in research. Our research is all confidential
        and voluntary; we protect participants' information, and they can choose to withdraw from research at any time.
        When practitioners participate in research, policy makers and other education leaders gain a better
        understanding of how they can better support effective instruction for students with disabilities.</p>
