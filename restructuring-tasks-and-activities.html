    <h3>Restructuring Tasks and Activities</h3>
    <p>Sometimes, students aren’t successful using skills or strategies the first time around. They might have misconceptions about new content or be focused on irrelevant or distracting details. When this happens, instead of continuing down the same instructional path, teachers restructure tasks and activities to efficiently and effectively help students succeed. Using student responses to drive their instructional decisions, teachers adjust tasks and activities so that students   are   consistently   moving   toward   mastery   of   the   planned instructional objective. </p>

    <p>In special education, teachers restructure tasks and questions in order to ensure that students experience high rates of success and make progress toward the planned instructional objective. This is different than in general education, where teachers might restructure tasks based on student interest or questions with the goal of extending learning.</p>

    [collapsible heading="What could this look like?" elem="h4"]
    <ul>
        <li>Making a task more or less complex based on student responses</li>
        <li>Remodeling a skill or strategy when students do not demonstrate mastery</li>
        <li>Using  instructional prompts, reminders, and cues when students are unsuccessful (e.g., saying, “OK, let’s look at our anchor chart and use it to guide our steps when solving this problem”)</li>
        <li>Reviewing previously learned materials and explicitly connecting the review to student errors, misconceptions, or exhibited needs</li>
    </ul>
