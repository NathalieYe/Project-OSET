    <h3>Using Affirmative and Corrective Feedback</h3>
    <p>Teacher feedback helps students to understand two things. First, affirmative feedback  students what they have done well and should continue doing.Second, corrective feedback tells students what and how they can improve their work. To be effective, this feedback should be timely and, during guided practice, it should be immediate. During independent practice, it should be delayed to allow for practice. </p>

    <p>By offering feedback throughout guided and independent practice, teachers create   additional   learning   opportunities   for   students.   They   quickly   and explicitly teach students the expectations for high-quality work. They prevent students from inaccurately practicing skills and strategies — and therefore decrease future errors and ensure successful learning. </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Providing   corrective   feedback   to   address   specific   errors   and misconceptions (e.g., OK, James, 7 x 3 is 21 but 7 x 4 is 28. Let’s try it again... )</li>
        <li>Prompting students to re-apply a skill or strategy successfully following corrective feedback</li>
        <li>Providing affirmative feedback that highlights what a student did well(e.g., Yes, James, you are correct that 7 x 4 is 28. Good job! )</li>
        <li>Offering feedback in a timely and direct manner</li>
