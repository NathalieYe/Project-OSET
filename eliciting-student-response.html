    <h3>Eliciting Student Responses</h3>
    <p>Special education teachers use a variety of verbal and nonverbal strategies to elicit student responses. They elicit student responses regularly and for one of two purposes: to check for student understanding and to engage students in constructing knowledge. By checking for understanding, teachers can gauge whether students are ready to move on to practicing a skill or strategy, or whether any content needs to be retaught. Teachers may also elicit responses to help students elaborate their thinking or make connections between critical concepts. </p>

    [collapsible heading="Why is eliciting responses important for students with disabilities?" elem="h4"]
    <p>For teachers of students with disabilities, questions plays a number of key roles in the classroom. When students have attention issues, frequent responses   ensure   that   they   maintain   their   engagement   in   instruction. Further, for the student who is not confident in their own expertise or who is overwhelmed by complex learning tasks, effective questioning may serve to scaffold students’ construction of knowledge.   </p>
