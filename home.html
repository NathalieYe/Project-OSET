    <p>When your own background is not in special education, it can be challenging to evaluate special education teachers! Even for administrators who do have special education experience, it is challenging to keep up with the field’s best practices.</p>
    <p>With this in mind, we developed the Observing Special Education Toolkit, a digital resource to support principals and other administrators. Our hope is that you find these tools helpful for evaluating your special educators and for planning targeted professional development.</p>

        <h4>Key practices for special education</h4>
        <p>This tool introduces five evidence-based instructional practices for students with disabilities. We recognize that teachers have many goals in their instruction, including meeting students’ academic, social, and emotional needs in culturally responsive ways. In this library, we highlight five practices that specifically support students with disabilities.</p>
